### Serialization/DeSerialization

* **What is Serialization ?**
  * Serialization is a process of writing the state of an object into a byte stream.It is mainly used to travel objectâ€™s state on the network.
  * Serializable is a marker interface. Interface which does not have methods.
* **What is Deserialization ?**
  * Deserialization is the process of reconstructing the object from the serialized state.It is the reverse operation of serialization.
* **What is transient keyword ?** 
  * If you define any data member as transient,it will not be serialized.
* **What is Marker interface ?**
  * An interface that have no data member and method is known as a marker interface. For example Serializable.
